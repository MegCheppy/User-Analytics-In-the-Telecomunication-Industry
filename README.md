## An analysis of TellCo's data, to see if it's worth purchasing.
You are working for a wealthy investor that specialises in purchasing assets that are undervalued.  This investor’s due diligence on all purchases includes a detailed analysis of the data that underlies the business, to try to understand the fundamentals of the business and especially to identify opportunities to drive profitability by changing the focus of which products or services are being offered.

The investor is interested in purchasing TellCo, an existing mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia.  TellCo’s current owners have been willing to share their financial information but have never employed anyone to look at their data that is generated automatically by their systems.

Your employer wants you to provide a report to analyse opportunities for growth and make a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.  You will do this by analysing a telecommunication dataset that contains useful information about the customers & their activities on the network. You will deliver insights you managed to extract to your employer through an easy to use web based dashboard and a written report. 


To guage whether Tellco is worth buying or not, we will build a machine learning model that predicts customer satisafaction in the coming in the future, using a regression model.
